### Background
The spatial organization of chromatin within the nucleus plays a crucial role in gene
regulation and stress responses in eukaryotes. However, in plants, our understanding of how
3D chromatin architecture is remodeled upon exposure to environmental stress remains
limited. In this study, we aim to investigate the structural dynamics of chromatin in rice
(Oryza sativa) under drought conditions.  

### Methods
High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) chromatin contact maps of Oryza sativa under
standard growth conditions have been previously generated using advanced chromatin
conformation capture techniques, including Pore-C, Hi-C, and Micro-C. These intrachromosomal contacts have been shown to facilitate the identification of potential
regulatory interactions between cis-regulatory elements and their target genes. To detect
the dynamics in architecture between standard and drought conditions, we aim to first
complement our current dataset by constructing a 3D chromatin interaction map of rice
under drought conditions.
We will compare the chromatin organization of drought-stressed and control growth
conditions. Primary, we will focus on the structural dynamics of topologically associated
domains (TADs), which are genomic regions characterized by high intra-domain interactions
and play a crucial role in gene regulation. We will determine whether drought stress induces
significant remodeling of chromatin architecture.  

### Conclusion
This study will enhance our understanding of how 3D chromatin architecture is remodeled in
response to drought stress and its impact on gene regulation in rice. By identifying structural
alterations in topologically associated domains and chromatin interactions under drought
conditions,  we aim to uncover regulatory mechanisms that facilitate stress-responsive gene
expression.
